      <h3>THE RIGHT BREED FOR YOU</h3>
      <p>
        When choosing a dog are we going for the looks or the personality? Some people prefer a 
        big guard dog while others just wanted a cute little companion. Choosing the right breed 
        is no easy decision. You should consider your lifestyle, the amount of space in your house, 
        he people surrounding you, and the budget you are willing to spend on your companion. Dogs 
        are loyal and loving companions and choosing the right breed that fits your personality makes 
        all the difference in you and your dog's happiness. Now the question is which breed is right for you?
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Consider the following:</h3>
      <p>
        Size - some small dogs are delicate and more vulnerable to injury. Being stepped on or mishandled can cause serious injury. Also, little dogs can 
        be more sensitive to colder temperatures, so be ready to help keep them warm. They may also need more frequent meals and potty breaks due to their small size, 
        so this can make them more high maintenance than some larger dogs. Very large dogs need a bit more space to move around. Big, happy dogs with long, whip-like tails need "wagging space" to avoid tail injury or damage 
        to household objects. Another consideration is the expenses: the larger the dog, the more expensive things like dog food, dog supplies, and medical treatments become.
        
        Activity Level -  You probably already know that some dogs have more energy than others. A dog's activity level is often determined by breed, but it does not mean you can rely on breed alone to determine how energetic your dog could become. 
        Every dog needs routine exercise, regardless of breed or size, so make sure you can provide this daily. If you know you cannot commit to more than one or two casual walks per day, then you will probably be better off with a lower-energy dog
        
        Physical Maintenance -  Your dog's appearance has a lot to do with his maintenance needs. All dogs need basic grooming, but certain types need more based on the type of hair coat. If you get a dog with hair that keeps growing, 
        then advanced routine grooming is essential. Most short-haired, smooth-coated dogs are major shedders, so be prepared to do some extra cleaning up. Some grooming tools can help reduce shedding.
        Be aware that dogs with long, floppy ears are more prone to ear infections and may require frequent thorough ear cleanings. And many small breed dogs are prone to dental disease, which can require costly dental procedures 
        as well as dedicated regular brushing at home.

        Age - Puppies require the greatest amount of training and attention, especially over the first six months. Be prepared to dedicate much of your time to housebreaking and raising your new puppy. Adult dogs can be an excellent choice. An adult might be a better choice if you want to have a good idea of the true energy level, attitude, and temperament of your new dog.
        
        Physical Appearance - When picking the right dog for you, most of the time their appearance is what captures you the most. It could be their cuteness or just the toughness of their looks.
        
        Breed - Purebred dogs are undeniably popular. Many people are attracted to a specific dog breed for various reasons. Perhaps you were raised around the breed or have spent a lot of time with the breed in your life. Maybe you really love the way a certain breed looks and acts. Or, you might feel the breed is right for you based on what you have read or heard about the breed. If you want a purebred dog, be sure you thoroughly research the breed.
