        <h2>Size</h2>
        <h3>Some small dogs are delicate and more vulnerable to injury. Being stepped on or mishandled can cause serious injury. Also, little dogs can 
            be more sensitive to colder temperatures, so be ready to help keep them warm. They may also need more frequent meals and potty breaks due to their small size, 
            so this can make them more high maintenance than some larger dogs. Very large dogs need a bit more space to move around. Big, happy dogs with long, whip-like tails need "wagging space" to avoid tail injury or damage 
            to household objects. Another consideration is the expenses: the larger the dog, the more expensive things like dog food, dog supplies, and medical treatments become.</h3>

        <h3>
            Puppies require the greatest amount of training and attention, especially over the first six months. Be prepared to 
            dedicate much of your time to housebreaking and raising your new puppy. Adult dogs can be an excellent choice. 
            An adult might be a better choice if you want to have a good idea of the true energy level, attitude, and temperament
            of your new dog.
