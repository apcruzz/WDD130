<h1>HAPPINESS</h1>

<p>Hi, this is Faith speaking, and I'd like all of you to know what is one of my most memorable days. 

I am proud to say that I actually have a big family. The family that I am in is what brings inspiration to me, they all are tough and brave hearted, smart and wise, loving and caring. They never ceased to amaze me with how tough the bond that each of us have. They're literally the light of my life. 

Each and every family have darkness and brightness sides, and we're one of that. The only thing that makes us unique is, we're growing stronger each challenge that we are facing and not apart, like other families, we are a team! If one needs help, expect that we all are going to have that one's back. We NEVER have left any member of the family alone. Yes, challenges are ominous, it can cause the brokenness of a family, but as I've said, we are unique, we are a team, we are and always will be "Family".

My family loves vacation I must say, we are always "go" to ever outing that we want and can think of. One of the best of our vacation was on May 2022.</p>
