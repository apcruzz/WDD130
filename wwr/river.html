        <h2>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. 
            This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. 
            We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early 
            season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures 
            soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in 
            the water at those temperatures.</h2>

        <h2>Grand Canyon Arizona</h2>
        <h3>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. 
            You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

            Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
            one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, 
            but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</h3>

        <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
        <h3>
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in 
            the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, 
            slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim 
            tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
